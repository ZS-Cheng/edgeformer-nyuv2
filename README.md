## Introduction
Recently, vision transformers started to show impressive results which outperform large convolution based models significantly. However, in the area of small models for mobile or resource constrained devices, ConvNet still has its own advantages in both performance and model complexity. We propose ParC-Net, a pure ConvNet based backbone model that further strengthens these advantages by fusing the merits of vision transformers into ConvNets.  Specifically, we propose position aware circular convolution (ParC), a light-weight convolution op which boasts a global receptive field while producing location sensitive features as in local convolutions. We combine the ParCs and squeeze-exictation ops to form a meta-former like model block, which further has the attention mechanism like transformers. The aforementioned block can be used in plug-and-play manner to replace relevant blocks in ConvNets or transformers. Experiment results show that the proposed ParC-Net achieves better performance than popular light-weight ConvNets and vision transformer based models in common vision tasks and datasets, while having fewer parameters and faster inference speed. For classification on ImageNet-1k, ParC-Net achieves 78.6% top-1 accuracy with about 5.0 million parameters, saving 11% parameters and 13% computational cost but gaining 0.2% higher accuracy and 23% faster inference speed (on ARM based Rockchip RK3288) compared with MobileViT, and uses only 0.5× parameters but gaining 2.7% accuracy compared with DeIT. On MS-COCO object detection and PASCAL VOC segmentation tasks, ParC-Net also shows better performance.

### Inference speed
We deploy the proposed EdgeFormer and baseline on widely used low power chip Rockchip RK3288 and DP chip for comparison. DP is the code name of
a in house unpublished low power neural network processor that highly optimizes the convolutions. We use ONNX [1] and MNN to port these models to RK3288 and DP chip and time each model for 100 iterations to measure the average inference speed.

### Applying Edgeformer designs on various lightweight backbones
Classification experiments. CPU used here is Xeon E5-2680 v4. *Authors of EdgeViT do not clarify the type of CPU used in their paper. ** We train ResNet50 with training strategy proposed in ConvNext. ResNet50 achieves 79.1 top 1 accuracy, which is much higher than 76.5 the accuracy reported in the original paper.

In terms of designing a pure ConvNet via learning from ViTs, our proposed ParC-Net is most closely related to a parallel work ConvNext. By comparing ParC-Net with Convnext, we notice that their improvements are different and complementary. To verify this point, we build a combination network, where ParC blocks are used to replace several ConvNext blocks in the end of last two stages. Experiment results show that **the replacement signifcantly improves classification accuracy, while slightly decreases the number of parameters**. Results on ResNet50, MobileNetV2 and ConvNext-T shows that models which focus on optimizing FLOPs-accuracy trade-offs can also benefit from our ParC-Net designs. Corresponding code will be released soon.
